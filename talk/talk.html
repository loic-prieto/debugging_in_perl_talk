							- Linux Desktop
							- a visual debugger.

							- You made the bad choice and now those guys in the boat look at you with a smirk while you drown.
							- What happens then? you don't go to heaven, thats for sure. No. You've got to maintain an undocumented perl project written 
							  by some clever guy.
							- You end up working directly on a check of one of the opsview slaves of MRW with no GUI.

						<h2>The perl debugger</h2>
						
						<aside class="notes">
							- GDB-like UI
							- Here is where it gets interesting. Tell about what it allows.
							- live demo with debugging_debugger_inside_module.pl

							- Navigate through the code with 'l' and '-'. Navigate to method with SomeMethod::say_hello
							- put a breakpoint with 'b'
							- list current breakpoints with 'L'. Explain conditional breakpoints.
							- inspect variable values with 'x'
							- examine object methods with 'm'
							- add watchers for variables with 'w', list them with 'L'

							- debug the problem with debugging_debugger_inside_module.pl, which is the name in $self is accessed as a method, but is a hash key. 
							  Also the constructor should give the name in the args as $args{name} since we want an item.

							- Perform the same debugging with debugging_debugger_outside_module. We can set breakpoints the same way: SomeModule::say_hello

						<h2 style="color:red;background-color:white">Debugging when the module has not been loaded yet</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Before showing the $DB::single=1 line, talk about more complex pieces of software like the portal.
							- Once the portal runs, it doesn't admit any more commands, so they must be inputted before running.
							- But the modules are not yet loaded.
							- Show the code about the system API (CpPortal::Controller::API::v1).
							- Try to put a breakpoint there, but show that it is not yet loaded.
							- Now show the $DB::single=1 line
							- Put a $DB::single=1 in line 25 of that controller and run the portal in debug with "make run-server-with-live-debugger"
							- Use the browser and go to: localhost:3000 to perform login and then to localhost:3000/api/v1/system/2504
							- Inspect variables and some lines before stopping.
